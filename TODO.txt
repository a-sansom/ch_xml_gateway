- Better error reporting. Pass errors the ch object contains through
to template. Currently only displaying minimal 'No <servicename> data'
type messages.

- Use watchdog to log errors.

- Keep tabs on how much a user has/is allowed to spend (not all 
services are chargeable), deducting credit when they query chargeable
services.

- Keep tabs on site bought credit in admin (site buys credit at CH and 
allocates to users). Enable a credit threshold that stops people 
querying when it's reached.

- Store normalised data that is a product of all users searches (this
would only be relevant for a certain point in time though as data is
updated on a daily basis at Companies House)

- Implement any other services
